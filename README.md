# Projects
Projects to showcase to potential employer
In this project folder you will see these notable projects highlighting my skills:
1. Dictionary
   This is the compiled version of an applet I wrote in C++ to help me solve questions of the game 'Word Brain' on IOS
   The goal is to check all permutation of a given string, and print out meaningful ones that present in an dictionary.

2. Web development
   This contains my most notable self-proposed projects I have completed during my 1.5 year study up to this point so far
   
   2.1 Online homepage
       Solely based on HTML and CSS with little Javascript used. I made this as a final project in my Basic of web programming course (1st year).
       Page is built with the help of Boostrap Twitter as an CSS framework

   2.2 JS game (Ball_game.HTML)
       I build this game as a hobby.
       Game is built using canvas as UI, and JS as application logic.
       Game is made in December, 2015
       More details about the game (how to play, etc.) can be found in the readme in the folder

   2.3 ReactJS form
       I am still working on this new front end technology.
       This small application is to help me understand how the technology works.
